TestNG concept
TDD - Test Driven Development 

It is like JUnit to execute the test cases
we can generate reports using TestNG
different annotations
different dependency
Grouping
data provider ---- very good option to use data multiple times 
priority/sequence


We never work with main class in TestNG
